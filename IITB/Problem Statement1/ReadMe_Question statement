 *                                                                           *

 *                               Write a C programme that accepts a string   *
 * and print all the possible palindromes that can be generated using the    *
 * letters of the string                                                     *
 * Note: single characters are a palindrome                                  *
 * Input  : I.1) A string of  characters                                     *
 * Outputs: O.1) Total number of palindromes found                           *
 *          O.2) Palindromes output on standard output                       *
 *                                                                           *
 * Note : duplicate palindromes are not allowed                              *
 *        output need not be sorted                                          *
 *                                                                           *
 * Hint : A brute force algorithm will create all possible strings and then  *
 *        check for palindromes. This will work for upto 7-8 character input.*
 *        This may fetch upto 50% of marks.                                  *
 *                                                                           *
 *        You will need to write a permutations algorithm as well as a       *
 *        combination algorithm                                              *
 *        Our solution uses the algorithms published by tamu CSE dept.       *
 *        The algorithms need to be modified to avoid duplicate generation   *
 *        for efficiency. Alternately inefficient algorithms may choose to   *
 *        store the result and remove duplicates later (a costly operation). *
 *        Duplcates are because of characters repeating more than 4 times.   *
 *                                                                           *
 *        A better algorith will try to build all possible heads and tails   *
 *        and then construct the palindrome using the remaining characters   *
 *                                                                           *
 * Hint : A better algorithm will be able to handle test t6 (amitabhbacchan) *
 *        Test t7 is given for algorithms which are better than our solution *
 *        There are more complex strings between test 6 and test 7           *
 *                                                                           *
 * Hint : The algorithms will be tested on increasing order of complex tests *
 *                                                                           *
 *                                                                           *

 *  Example 6 will be one of the samples used for performance testing        *
 *  Example 7 takes significant ampount of time (minutes) for our solution   *

 * The tests would cover many more complex cases                             *
 * There will be some tests to determine how much length your algorithm can  *
 * process in 2 minutes on our machine                                       *
