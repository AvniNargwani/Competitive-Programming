Tell us your Hacktoberfest story: I was excited about the Hactoberfest at first and found it very legitimate and helpful in finding the issues labelled as hactoberfest. I first started with submitting pull requests on very small patches like in documentation and small code repositories but as soon as contributed to 2-3 repos, I had a grasp of how it is like to contribute to open source and it was really a fun, then I began understanding large code repository structures and began contributing to them. I have a lot more to say. Thanks!
